# SFML-CPP-Platformer

A little platformer that I have built on top of my own 2D engine that is written in C++/SFML. It has been just over a year from when I first began to learn how to program and this is a culmination of what I have learned throughout that time.

The player has the ability to move around the level, attack enemies, jump, get hurt by enemies and advance onto the next level upon reaching a certain tile in map. Some other notable things are state management, resource management, hand made collision detection and the ability to read in spritesheets including animations.
